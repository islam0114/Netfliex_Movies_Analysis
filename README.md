# Netfliex_Movies_Analysis
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a dataset of Netflix movies and TV shows to uncover insights about content distribution, trends, and patterns. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and Power BI, the project applies data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to answer key questions about Netflix’s content strategy.
